Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a tool widely used by organizations to understand the general opinion of consumers of their product and services. It helps organizations to take decisions based on the polarity of the audiences towards their products. Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is one of the sentiment analysis techniques employed by businesses to understand the consumer opinion of a certain attribute of their product or service instead. This will help businesses to choose aspects that are desirable to the consumers. However, this is a complex task to achieve. 

BERT is one of the machine learning techniques used to perform ABSA. This report explains in detail the architecture of BERT. In order to do this, we look at the laptop reviews provided by the users. This project presents the study of how the Aspect-based sentiment analysis is performed using the pre-trained language model BERT. The behaviour of model predictions is explained using the component called professor, which helps to observe how the model predicted the sentiment for a particular aspect. The results and performance of the Aspect based sentiment analysis model are analysed using the confusion matrix and presented in the report.

The report is in the file ABSA_report.
